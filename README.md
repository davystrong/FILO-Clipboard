# FILO Clipboard

Very simple First In Last Out clipboard for Windows written in Rust. Text is automatically added to the clipboard history (the max length of which can be specified) and the clipboard is triggered with Ctrl+Shift+V.

The objective of this program is to do one thing without slowing down the computer with other unnecessary features.
